A little bit about myself, I am currently an Under graduate student, pursuing bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering at Mar Athanasius college of Engineering, Kerala. I am working on Deep Learning especially in Computer Vision field. I had completed Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera by deeplearning.ai and studying Data Science at HavardX and also participating in Deep Learning hackathons and competetions. I always enjoy the learning and practicing on Deep Learning and Data Science. And looking forward to persue a career in the same field.
